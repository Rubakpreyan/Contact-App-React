# Contact list-App

This is a basic Contact list Application done by using **React** and **semantic UI** .

## Concepts used :

- _props_
- _Hooks_
  - UseState()
  - UseEffect()

## Working

Initailly we need to enter the _Name_ and _Email id_. Once these details are entered the data will be stored locally in the browser using **setItem()** and **getItem()** so even though the browser is Closed the data wont be erased.
